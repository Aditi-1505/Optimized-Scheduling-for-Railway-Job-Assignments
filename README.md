The primary objective of this project is to develop an optimized and scalable Railway Job Scheduling System capable of handling the complex, NP-hard nature of train scheduling. 
The system applies graph theory and optimization techniques -specifically Dijkstra’s algorithm, greedy algorithms (such as interval scheduling), and 0/1 knapsack dynamic 
programming—to achieve efficient allocation of railway resources. The goal is to minimize train delays, optimize the utilization of available tracks, and manage conflicting job 
schedules such as train arrivals, departures, and track maintenance. By modeling the railway network as a weighted directed graph, the system uses :-
•	Dijksta’s algorithm: This algorithm calculates the shortest path based on factors like distance, time, and track availability. This ensures optimal routing for trains, reduces delays, 
and improves overall traffic flow across the network.
•	Greedy algorithm(Interval Scheduling): This technique is used to allocate time slots efficiently by selecting the maximum number of non-overlapping activities—such as platform 
assignments for arriving and departing trains. By avoiding scheduling conflicts, it helps optimize resource usage and improve overall station throughput.
•	0/1 Knapsack algorithm: 0/1 Knapsack DP aids in selecting the most valuable set of jobs or cargos within resource constraints such as track time or manpower.
